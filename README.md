# MWD220Final

This is an HCID 220P final project by Jared Kozar and Derek Delgado. In this project, we are attempting to visualize some of the best selling video games of all time using a pie chart. We look at the sales that each video game have earned to determine which are the top games of the world. We are using a data set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales).
